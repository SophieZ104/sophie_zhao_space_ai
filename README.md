Machine learning for determining risk of solar flares that can pose a threat to spacecraft.

FIRST: Edit the path to the csv file where it says pd.read_csv after downloading the csv file. It currently does not have a path since the code has been done on Replit where the csv file was uploaded. 
If a spacecraft encounters a solar flare, there is the possibility of severe damage to the spacecrafta. The included dataset is a dummy dataset. The parameters include frequency of extreme ultraviolet flashes (Hz), the brightness of a local area of the Sun (Cd) directly in front of the spacecraft, and the amount of change in solar magnetic flux per second (Wb/s). These factors contribute to the likelihood of a solar flare. Note that the values in the dummy dataset are arbitrary and are not necessarily close to the actual values of the parameters. If there is a risk of a solar flare, the spacecraft will temporarily change its trajectory to avoid the Sun.
